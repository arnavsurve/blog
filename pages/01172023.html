    <h1>My first blog post</h1>
    <p>
      Hello citizens of the internet! For my first post, I guess I should
      introduce myself. I'm Arnav, a freshman at Purdue University studying
      cybersecurity. I decided to start this blog after a meeting with a few
      members of the Anvaya Solutions team, a cybersecurity company based in my
      hometown of Folsom, California. One of the people I talked with, Bek,
      recommended I start a blog to document my learning and personal projects,
      so here we are.

      You might be wondering why this website looks so good, and it's all
      intentional. I thought I'd go with a more minimalist approach, as I
      actually kind of feel like this makes my page stand out from every other
      generic bootstrap html blog clone. And who doesn't love monospaced fonts??
      As of writing this post, I only have a barebones template for myself to
      work off of and a few page templates for me to use. I haven't even hosted
      this yet, but I'm thinking either Github pages or Heroku. I also plan on
      adding a section to display personal projects in the near future, but for
      now<a href="http://arnavsurve.github.io/portfolio">here's a link</a>to my
      old portfolio website so you can see how much better this one is.

      Right now, relevant classes I'm taking are:<br />
      CNIT270 - Cybersecurity Fundamentals <br />
      CNIT15501 - Introduction to Sofware Development Concepts
      <br />
      As of now, I haven't learned anything notable or new but I'll update this
      as I go along.

      I'm also part of a development team working on a grant application for the
      Purdue Office of Engagement through the Data Mine at Purdue, a data
      science focused learning community. My main role is on the backend team,
      which involves writing APIs and working on the database schema. The
      project is built with React and Express.js and we are using TypeScript for
      the entirety of it, which has been interesting to use. I will say I like
      it more than vanilla JS, but not enough to actually use it on my own
      &#128556;. I'm not the biggest JavaScript fan.

      In terms of my self-learning right now, I've been getting into learning C.
      It's something I have basically no experience in, as I've just been using
      relatively higher level languages in the past (Python, JS, etc). I feel
      like my understanding of pretty fundamental software development concepts
      such as pointers and memory allocation is lacking, and I think learning C
      will give me some insight into that. Also, C just seems like a really
      important language to know in general if I want to get into reverse
      engineering and writing some of my own exploits. For now, the most I've
      done is a basic calculator &#128580; but hopefully I'll have some more
      interesting stuff to show on here soon.

      I think I'll also make a post going over my terminal workflow and some
      apps I use because I think that'll be fun to write about, but this is it
      for now. Thanks for reading!
