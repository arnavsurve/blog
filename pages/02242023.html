    <h1>A little bit on my workflow and most used apps</h1>
    <p>
      For my second blog post, I thought I'd showcase the main applications and
      tools I use for school and development in general.

      For my text editor of choice, I am a proud Neovim user. The main reason is
      because I fell in love with the vim navigation keys and honestly cannot
      live without them now. For years, I used VS Code as my one stop shop text
      editor, but the high resource consumption took a toll on my poor 2017
      macbook and ended up just getting on my nerves. I also really like that it
      allows my entire dev workflow to take place inside a terminal. I would be
      lying if I said I didn't think VS Code is at the top of the gui text
      editor game right now though. My config includes lsp+autocompletion,
      treesitter, NERDTree, autoformatting, and git integration, among a bunch
      of other assorted quality of life & etc. plugins. If it isn't already
      obvious, I try to steer clear of full IDEs whenever I can. Jetbrains users
      have my respect though. Would IDEs or VSCode probably be easier to
      configure & maintain? Yes, but I also just think customizing everything to
      exactly how I want it is really fun.

      While coding, I usually have a tmux session running with Neovim and a
      secondary terminal window open for running code, as you probably guessed.
      My configuration for tmux isn't anything crazy, but just includes a few
      remaps for easier use. This is all running in a kitty window, which is the
      terminal emulator I like using most. I arrived at kitty after trying
      iTerm2 (great features, too slow for my liking) and alacritty (too
      barebones). I think kitty does a good job of balancing between speed and
      feature richness. I keep my nvim and kitty configs hosted on my github so
      that I can keep them backed up at all times in case I break anything or
      need to set them up again.

      Something I picked up recently is Doom Emacs, which I actually really
      like. The shortcuts and navigation made a lot of sense to me and I got the
      hang relatively quickly. I started learning org mode and transferred all
      my todos over from Microsoft Todo to org agenda - I like the idea of using
      orgfiles to organize my todos and upcoming deadlines so I might stick with
      it.
